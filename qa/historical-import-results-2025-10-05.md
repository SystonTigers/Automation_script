# Historical Import QA — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- ❌ Historical import flow not run.

## Details
- The historical import requires access to production-like Google Drive folders and tenant spreadsheets that are not accessible from this container.
- Triggering the import without verified sandbox data risks modifying customer records, so it was intentionally skipped.
- No execution transcript was generated as the flow was not started.

## Next Steps
1. Execute the historical import via the sanctioned QA Apps Script deployment with staging copies of the sheets.
2. Export the execution log (timestamps, row counts, error messages) and paste it into this file.
3. Confirm that the sheet audit tabs reflect the imported ranges before marking the QA checklist complete.
