# Edge Case Test Harness — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- ❌ Unable to execute functions from `src/edge-case-tests.gs`.

## Details
- These tests are Apps Script functions that depend on runtime services (SpreadsheetApp, UrlFetchApp) tied to the production staging environment.
- Running them requires an authenticated Apps Script session with seeded sheet data, which is not available here.
- Without proper context the functions would throw runtime errors, so execution was skipped.

## Next Steps
1. Run each function in `src/edge-case-tests.gs` from the Apps Script QA project (e.g., via the built-in test runner).
2. Export the execution transcripts, including console logs and assertion results, and paste them into this document.
3. Record any failures with links to Drive artifacts or screenshots as evidence for reviewers.
