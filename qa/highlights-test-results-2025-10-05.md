# Highlights Export QA — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- ❌ Highlights export automation not executed.

## Details
- The export job calls third-party APIs and writes to Drive folders that require customer-specific credentials; these secrets are not provisioned in this sandbox.
- Without the proper Script Properties and OAuth grants, the job cannot be executed safely.
- No console output is available because the job was never started.

## Next Steps
1. Re-run the highlights export from the Apps Script QA project with the correct tenant bindings.
2. Save the Apps Script execution log (including timestamps and item counts) and update this artifact.
3. Verify that the exported files appear in the staging Drive folder before closing the QA ticket.
