# Feature parity matrix (current plan)

| Feature | Status | Implementation / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Matchday live posts (Apps Script sheet → backend `/api/v1/post`) | ✅ | Live match inputs are queued through `LiveEventDebouncer.queueEvent/processEventQueue` before delegating to `processLiveEvent`, which hands off to `EnhancedEventsManager` goal/card handlers and ultimately `MakeIntegration.sendToMake` with backend-first routing via `postToBackend`. |
| Homepage widget: single latest update, 90-min auto-expire | ❌ | No homepage widget logic is present in the web client or backend; the work remains tracked in the roadmap checklist. |
| Cards/sin-bin flow not counted as goals; icons; stats update | ⚠️ | Enhanced card handling (`processCardEvent` → `processTeamCard`/`processOppositionCard`/`processSecondYellow`) plus `PlayerManagementManager.updatePlayerCardStats` keep goals separate and update stats, but the payload builder lacks any icon metadata so the visual layer is still outstanding. |
| Postponements `_sendToMake({type:'match_postponed_*'})` path behind backend | ✅ | `BatchFixturesManager.postPostponed` composes `match_postponed_*` payloads, feeds them through its consent-aware `sendBatchToMake`, and `MakeIntegration.sendToMake` routes via the backend with retry/backoff before falling back to the direct webhook. |
| FA snippets → league table pipeline (Raw → Sorted → Canva Map → `table.html`) | ❌ | Outside of health checks that assert the tabs exist, there is no automation wiring the Raw/Sorted/Canva sheets into a generated `table.html`; the backlog still calls this out as a to-do. |
| Schedulers: 3d/2d/1d/matchday; Monthly fixtures (1st); TBT; birthdays; quotes w/ char guard | ⚠️ | Weekly scheduler covers the 3d/2d/1d countdowns, matchday hand-off, throwbacks, and rotating quotes, and the monthly manager triggers fixtures/results/GOTM on schedule, but there is no birthday automation and the quotes payload has no character-limit guard yet. |
| Highlights: now includes `exportEventsForHighlights` + `triggerHighlightsBot` | ✅ | The highlights module exports filtered event JSON to Drive via `exportEventsForHighlights` and optionally pings downstream automation through `triggerHighlightsBot` with retries and request metadata. |
| Monthly montage + GOTM | ⚠️ | GOTM voting/winner flows live in `monthly-gotm.gs`, yet there is still no monthly montage automation — it remains on the roadmap. |
| Sponsor overlays | ❌ | Sponsor overlay generation is not implemented in the current Apps Script or backend code and is only referenced as future roadmap work. |
| Website pages present; archive label fixed; player stats theme fixed | ❌ | The single-page web app exists, but there is no implementation for the requested homepage/archive/player-stats visual fixes and they remain listed as carryover tasks. |
| System: triggers installer idempotent; all config central; `@testHook` & logging coverage; retry/backoff; single web-app deployment | ✅ | `TriggerManager.ensureSingleTrigger` and the customer installer enforce idempotent setup against Sheet-backed config, the event/Make integration stack is instrumented with `@testHook` markers and structured logging, webhook/HTTP paths include exponential retry/backoff, and the deployment contract documents the single `WEBAPP_DEPLOYMENT_ID` model. |
