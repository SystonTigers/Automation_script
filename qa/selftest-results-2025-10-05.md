# Make Integration Self-Test Results — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- ❌ Unable to execute `runMakeIntegrationSelfTests()` in this environment.

## Details
- Attempted to locate executable entrypoint within repository, but the flow is defined in Apps Script (`src/qa.selftest.gs`) and requires execution inside the Google Apps Script runtime with access to staging/dev spreadsheets and Make.com webhooks.
- The current automation container does not have connectivity to the Apps Script project or authentication credentials (OAuth token / `clasp` environment) necessary to invoke the function remotely.
- Running the flow without the required secrets would fail and risk exposing production data, so the execution was skipped as a safety measure.

## Next Steps
1. Run `runMakeIntegrationSelfTests()` from the Apps Script editor or via the internal QA deployment that has the appropriate Script Properties configured.
2. Capture the execution transcript from the Apps Script execution log and attach it here.
3. Re-run once staging credentials are available in the automated test environment.
