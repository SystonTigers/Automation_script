## **üèÜ PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES & OPTIMIZATION**

**Target Date**: March 31, 2026
**Priority**: üü¢ LOW (Future Enhancement)
**Estimated Time**: 30 hours
**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è FUTURE PHASE

### **4.1 Advance
All tasks, milestones, and requirements listed below remain valid and must be included in full, unless they are explicitly superseded or refined by the text above or the System Workings ‚ÄúBible.‚Äù Where the Bible introduces new functionality (such as weekly content scheduling, Goal of the Season, sponsor page, livestreaming, or expanded control-panel features), these requirements are additive and should be incorporated alongside existing tasks rather than replacing them. In case of conflict between the text below and text above, the text above plus Bible take precedence.
# üìã TASKS ‚Äì Syston Tigers Football Automation System

**Status (Today):** Milestone 2 in progress ‚Äî Repo + CI scaffold created; Canva templates pending.  
**Principles:** Centralised config, no globals, idempotent ops, diagnostic logging, @testHook before/after external calls.  
**Docs:** See CLAUDE.md for coding rules and PLANNING.md for architecture/roadmap.

---

## üöÄ NOW (highest priority)

### A. Repo & CI (free, hands-off deploy)
- [ ] Add **service account** (Editor) to Apps Script project and container Sheet.
- [ ] Add GitHub secret `APPSCRIPT_CREDS_JSON_B64` (base64 of the SA JSON).
- [ ] Set `.clasp.json` `scriptId` and keep `rootDir: "src"`.
- [ ] Push a test change ‚Üí confirm **Actions ‚Üí clasp push** updates Apps Script.
- [ ] (Optional) Add a **sanity-check workflow** that fails if `src/appsscript.json` or `.clasp.json` is missing.

### B. Goal of the Month (GOTM) ‚Äî *final 30% of Milestone 2*
**Apps Script (`youtube-integration.gs`, new `GOTM` namespace)**
- [ ] `GOTM.findGoalsByMonth(month, year)` ‚Äî read `YouTube_Videos` sheet, return candidates.
- [ ] `GOTM.startGotmVoting(month, year)` ‚Äî create tab `GOTM_Vote_<m>_<y>` with headers: `Video_ID, Title, Upload_Date, Vote_Count` (all zeroed), idempotent if rerun.
- [ ] `GOTM.tallyGotmVotes(month, year)` ‚Äî compute winner; write to `GOTM_Winners` sheet with date, title, videoId, votes; return winner object.
- [ ] Add logging at entry/exit and `@testHook` around sheet I/O and any HTTP calls.
- [ ] Config: add sheet names & prefixes in `config.js` (no new globals).

**Make.com**
- [ ] Router branch `gotm_start_voting` ‚Üí call `GOTM.startGotmVoting(month,year)`.
- [ ] Router branch `gotm_tally_votes` ‚Üí call `GOTM.tallyGotmVotes(month,year)`; then post winner.
- [ ] Schedule: auto-open voting on **1st** (or first Monday) and auto-tally after **7 days**.

**Canva & Social**
- [ ] Create **Voting** template (1080√ó1080 + 1080√ó1920): `{{MONTH}} {{YEAR}}`, candidate list or carousel.
- [ ] Create **Winner** template: `{{TITLE}}`, `{{THUMB_URL}}`, `{{MONTH}} {{YEAR}}`, badge; style in club colours.
- [ ] Make.com fills placeholders and posts to social with #GOTM.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Re-running start/tally is idempotent (no dupes).
- [ ] Winner written to `GOTM_Winners` and posted once.
- [ ] Logs show full trace; errors handled without crashes.

### C. Social Video Distribution ‚Äî *completes Milestone 2*
**Apps Script (`youtube-integration.gs`, new `Social` namespace)**
- [ ] `Social.preparePostData(videoId)` ‚Üí fetch YouTube details (Advanced Service), build `{title,url,hashtags,message}`.
- [ ] `Social.generateSocialMessage(title,url)` ‚Äî short, platform-safe copy.
- [ ] `Social.extractHashtags(description)` ‚Äî parse `#tags`.

**Make.com**
- [ ] Branch `social_post_execute` ‚Üí call `Social.preparePostData` ‚Üí router to Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram.
- [ ] (Optional) Canva thumbnail/teaser template populated per platform.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] New YouTube upload triggers Make.com ‚Üí one post per platform.
- [ ] Handles missing/invalid videoId gracefully; no duplicate posts.

---

## ‚úÖ NEXT (short-term)

### D. Free documentation backup (Drive/Docs)
- [ ] Add `backupRepoToGoogleDoc()` (separate Apps Script or current project) that fetches raw GitHub URLs for all `src/*` and writes to **Google Doc**.
- [ ] Time-based trigger daily; store in Drive folder `Backups/AppsScript`.
- [ ] Optional: also save a `.zip` to Drive monthly.

### E. Homepage polish (carryover)
- [ ] Live updates box: keep **latest only**, auto-expire after **90 mins**.
- [ ] League table: generate `table.html` from Sheet; push to GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Colour/theme fixes across pages; menu bar consistency.

---

## üîú LATER (backlog aligned to roadmap)

### F. Cards & Sin-bin workflow (no impact on goals)
- [ ] Event capture UI + icons (üü®/üü•/üüß PNG).
- [ ] Update Player_Events and Player Stats (cards/sin-bin counters only).
- [ ] Social posts use icon overlays; maintain idempotency.

### G. Clips & Monthly Montage
- [ ] Timestamps ‚Üí FFmpeg/CloudConvert trimming.
- [ ] Auto-upload; write back YouTube URL.
- [ ] ‚ÄúGoal of the Month‚Äù short-list auto-populate from clip metadata.

- [ ] Verify placeholder set for results/HT-FT templates; enforce character limits.

### I. Platform expansion
- [ ] TikTok native posting via Make/API.
- [ ] Player profile pages export to GitHub; sponsor overlays on graphics.
- [ ] Retry/backoff for XbotGo pushes.

---

## üß™ Test Matrix (add cases as you build)
- [ ] GOTM: month with 0, 1, N goals; duplicate rerun; tie on votes.
- [ ] Social: missing videoId; private/unlisted video; very long titles.
- [ ] CI: missing secret; invalid scriptId; network failure (workflow retries).
- [ ] Backup: one file fetch fails; Doc write quota.

---

## üìå Definition of Done (per feature)
- Code follows CLAUDE.md rules (config centralised, idempotent, logging + hooks).
- Unit paths tested with deterministic samples.
- Make.com routes documented in repo JSON.
- Canva placeholders listed in PLANNING.md.
- README updated if public behaviour changes.
