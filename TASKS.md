## **🏆 PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES & OPTIMIZATION**

**Target Date**: March 31, 2026
**Priority**: 🟢 LOW (Future Enhancement)
**Estimated Time**: 30 hours
**Status**: ⏸️ FUTURE PHASE

### **4.1 Advance
All tasks, milestones, and requirements listed below remain valid and must be included in full, unless they are explicitly superseded or refined by the text above or the System Workings “Bible.” Where the Bible introduces new functionality (such as weekly content scheduling, Goal of the Season, sponsor page, livestreaming, or expanded control-panel features), these requirements are additive and should be incorporated alongside existing tasks rather than replacing them. In case of conflict between the text below and text above, the text above plus Bible take precedence.
# 📋 TASKS – Syston Tigers Football Automation System

**Status (Today):** Milestone 2 in progress — Repo + CI scaffold created; Canva templates pending.  
**Principles:** Centralised config, no globals, idempotent ops, diagnostic logging, @testHook before/after external calls.  
**Docs:** See CLAUDE.md for coding rules and PLANNING.md for architecture/roadmap.

Now let me provide the comprehensive summary and recommendations:

## **📋 CHANGE SUMMARY - Bible Core Implementation**

### **✅ Core Features Implemented:**

**1. Weekly Content Calendar Automation (`weekly-scheduler.gs`):**
- Monday: This week's fixtures / no match scheduled
- Tuesday: Quotes with rotation system
- Wednesday: Monthly player stats OR opposition analysis
- Thursday: Throwback content + 3-day countdown
- Friday: 2 days to go countdown
- Saturday: 1 day to go countdown
- Sunday: Match day priority (handled by match automation)

**2. Opposition Auto-Detection (`enhanced-events.gs`):**
- "Goal" from player dropdown = opposition goal automatically
- "Opposition" + card = opposition card automatically
- Opposition score updates only (no player stats affected)
- Separate Make.com payloads for opposition events

**3. Real-Time Player Minutes Tracking:**
- Automatic minutes calculation from kick-off to substitution
- Subs Log sheet for substitution tracking
- Real-time updates during live matches
- Player swapping between starting 11 and bench

**4. Video Integration Foundation:**
- Automatic clip metadata creation for every goal
- Notes system for video editor with player references
- Individual player folder organization in Google Drive
- Clip timing calculation (goal minute - 3 seconds)

**5. Control Panel System (`control-panel.gs`):**
- Feature toggles for all major components
- Manual historical data input capabilities
- Bulk CSV import functionality
- System health monitoring
- Settings export/import

### **🔧 Technical Enhancements:**

**Make.com Router Branches Required:**
```json
{
  "weekly_fixtures": "Monday fixtures or no match",
  "weekly_quotes": "Tuesday motivational quotes",
  "weekly_player_stats": "Wednesday monthly stats",
  "weekly_opposition_analysis": "Wednesday opposition analysis",
  "weekly_throwback": "Thursday throwback + countdown",
  "countdown_2_days": "Friday countdown",
  "countdown_1_day": "Saturday countdown",
  "goal_opposition": "Opposition goal events",
  "card_opposition": "Opposition discipline",
  "card_second_yellow": "Enhanced 2nd yellow cards"
}
```

**Canva Template Placeholders Required:**

**Weekly Content:**
- `week_start_date`, `fixture_count`, `fixtures_list`, `club_name`
- `quote_text`, `quote_author`, `throwback_content`, `countdown_days`

**Opposition Events:**
- `opponent_name`, `home_score`, `away_score`, `card_type`, `minute`

**Video Integration:**
- `clip_title`, `goal_scorer`, `assist_provider`, `video_duration`

---

## **🧪 EDGE CASE TESTS**

### **Test 1: Weekly Schedule with No Upcoming Matches**
```javascript
// Expected: Monday posts "no match scheduled", Friday/Saturday skip countdown
const result = testSpecificDay(1); // Monday
// Expected outcome: { success: true, contentType: 'monday_fixtures', 
//                    hasFixtures: false, message_type: 'no_matches_scheduled' }
```

### **Test 2: Opposition Goal During High-Scoring Match**
```javascript
// Expected: Opposition score increments only, no player stats affected
const result = processGoalEvent(67, 'Goal'); // "Goal" = opposition
// Expected outcome: { success: true, eventType: 'opposition_goal', 
//                    scores: { home: 3, away: 2 }, playerStatsUpdated: false }
```

### **Test 3: Multiple Substitutions with Minutes Calculation**
```javascript
// Expected: Accurate minutes for multiple player swaps
processSubstitution(60, 'Player A', 'Player B');
processSubstitution(75, 'Player C', 'Player D');
// Expected outcome: Player A = 60 minutes, Player C = 75 minutes, 
//                   Player B/D = remaining minutes calculated correctly
```

- **Fan engagement prediction**: Machine learning to optimize posting times based on engagement patterns
- **Content performance tracking**: A/B testing for different content types and templates
- **Bible compliance scoring**: Real-time dashboard showing adherence to system workings specification

### **6. Scalability Preparation**
- **Multi-club template system**: Abstract club-specific data for easy replication
- **White-label customization**: Allow other clubs to brand the system with their identity
- **API development**: Create REST API for third-party integrations

### **7. User Experience Improvements**
- **Mobile-friendly interface**: Optimize Google Sheets for mobile match day input
- **Voice input integration**: Allow voice commands for rapid match event logging
- **Predictive text**: Auto-complete player names and common event descriptions

### **8. Commercial Features**
- **Revenue tracking**: Monitor increased sponsorship value, social media monetization
- **ROI dashboard**: Real-time calculation of time saved and value generated
- **Licensing system**: Framework for selling system to other clubs

### **9. Integration Enhancements**
- **Social media direct posting**: Bypass Make.com for critical events to reduce dependency
- **Email automation**: Automatic match reports sent to stakeholders
- **Website integration**: Real-time data feeds to club website

### **10. Quality Assurance**
- **Automated testing suite**: Unit tests for all Bible-compliant functions
- **Continuous monitoring**: 24/7 health checks for all system components
- **User feedback loop**: Regular surveys to ensure system meets needs

## **🎯 IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY**

1. **Deploy weekly scheduler** with time-based triggers
2. **Test opposition detection** with live match scenarios  
3. **Validate player minutes calculation** accuracy
4. **Set up Control Panel** with all feature toggles
5. **Configure Make.com router** with all required branches
6. **Create Canva templates** with proper placeholders
7. **Train users** on Bible-compliant workflows

This implementation provides a production-ready foundation that exactly follows your system workings "Bible" while adding robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and scalable architecture for future growth.

## 🚀 NOW (highest priority)

### A. Repo & CI (free, hands-off deploy)
- [ ] Add **service account** (Editor) to Apps Script project and container Sheet.
- [ ] Add GitHub secret `APPSCRIPT_CREDS_JSON_B64` (base64 of the SA JSON).
- [ ] Set `.clasp.json` `scriptId` and keep `rootDir: "src"`.
- [ ] Push a test change → confirm **Actions → clasp push** updates Apps Script.
- [ ] (Optional) Add a **sanity-check workflow** that fails if `src/appsscript.json` or `.clasp.json` is missing.

### B. Goal of the Month (GOTM) — *final 30% of Milestone 2*
**Apps Script (`youtube-integration.gs`, new `GOTM` namespace)**
- [ ] `GOTM.findGoalsByMonth(month, year)` — read `YouTube_Videos` sheet, return candidates.
- [ ] `GOTM.startGotmVoting(month, year)` — create tab `GOTM_Vote_<m>_<y>` with headers: `Video_ID, Title, Upload_Date, Vote_Count` (all zeroed), idempotent if rerun.
- [ ] `GOTM.tallyGotmVotes(month, year)` — compute winner; write to `GOTM_Winners` sheet with date, title, videoId, votes; return winner object.
- [ ] Add logging at entry/exit and `@testHook` around sheet I/O and any HTTP calls.
- [ ] Config: add sheet names & prefixes in `config.js` (no new globals).

**Make.com**
- [ ] Router branch `gotm_start_voting` → call `GOTM.startGotmVoting(month,year)`.
- [ ] Router branch `gotm_tally_votes` → call `GOTM.tallyGotmVotes(month,year)`; then post winner.
- [ ] Schedule: auto-open voting on **1st** (or first Monday) and auto-tally after **7 days**.

**Canva & Social**
- [ ] Create **Voting** template (1080×1080 + 1080×1920): `{{MONTH}} {{YEAR}}`, candidate list or carousel.
- [ ] Create **Winner** template: `{{TITLE}}`, `{{THUMB_URL}}`, `{{MONTH}} {{YEAR}}`, badge; style in club colours.
- [ ] Make.com fills placeholders and posts to social with #GOTM.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Re-running start/tally is idempotent (no dupes).
- [ ] Winner written to `GOTM_Winners` and posted once.
- [ ] Logs show full trace; errors handled without crashes.

### C. Social Video Distribution — *completes Milestone 2*
**Apps Script (`youtube-integration.gs`, new `Social` namespace)**
- [ ] `Social.preparePostData(videoId)` → fetch YouTube details (Advanced Service), build `{title,url,hashtags,message}`.
- [ ] `Social.generateSocialMessage(title,url)` — short, platform-safe copy.
- [ ] `Social.extractHashtags(description)` — parse `#tags`.

**Make.com**
- [ ] Branch `social_post_execute` → call `Social.preparePostData` → router to Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram.
- [ ] (Optional) Canva thumbnail/teaser template populated per platform.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] New YouTube upload triggers Make.com → one post per platform.
- [ ] Handles missing/invalid videoId gracefully; no duplicate posts.

---

## ✅ NEXT (short-term)

### D. Free documentation backup (Drive/Docs)
- [ ] Add `backupRepoToGoogleDoc()` (separate Apps Script or current project) that fetches raw GitHub URLs for all `src/*` and writes to **Google Doc**.
- [ ] Time-based trigger daily; store in Drive folder `Backups/AppsScript`.
- [ ] Optional: also save a `.zip` to Drive monthly.

### E. Homepage polish (carryover)
- [ ] Live updates box: keep **latest only**, auto-expire after **90 mins**.
- [ ] League table: generate `table.html` from Sheet; push to GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Colour/theme fixes across pages; menu bar consistency.

---

## 🔜 LATER (backlog aligned to roadmap)

### F. Cards & Sin-bin workflow (no impact on goals)
- [ ] Event capture UI + icons (🟨/🟥/🟧 PNG).
- [ ] Update Player_Events and Player Stats (cards/sin-bin counters only).
- [ ] Social posts use icon overlays; maintain idempotency.

### G. Clips & Monthly Montage
- [ ] Timestamps → FFmpeg/CloudConvert trimming.
- [ ] Auto-upload; write back YouTube URL.
- [ ] “Goal of the Month” short-list auto-populate from clip metadata.

### H. Data→Canva mapping hardening
- [ ] Keep `League Raw → League Sorted → League Canva Map` pipeline healthy.
- [ ] Badge Map tab (HOME_BADGE_URL/AWAY_BADGE_URL) and Make.com media replace.
- [ ] Verify placeholder set for results/HT-FT templates; enforce character limits.

### I. Platform expansion
- [ ] TikTok native posting via Make/API.
- [ ] Player profile pages export to GitHub; sponsor overlays on graphics.
- [ ] Retry/backoff for XbotGo pushes.

---

## 🧪 Test Matrix (add cases as you build)
- [ ] GOTM: month with 0, 1, N goals; duplicate rerun; tie on votes.
- [ ] Social: missing videoId; private/unlisted video; very long titles.
- [ ] CI: missing secret; invalid scriptId; network failure (workflow retries).
- [ ] Backup: one file fetch fails; Doc write quota.

---

## 📌 Definition of Done (per feature)
- Code follows CLAUDE.md rules (config centralised, idempotent, logging + hooks).
- Unit paths tested with deterministic samples.
- Make.com routes documented in repo JSON.
- Canva placeholders listed in PLANNING.md.
- README updated if public behaviour changes.
