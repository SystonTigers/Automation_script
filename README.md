## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo
- **Single Source of Truth** – All Google Apps Script files in `src/` are versioned here.
- **AI-Friendly** – `CLAUDE.md`, `PLANNING.md`, and `TASKS.md` provide context and rules so AI tools can safely extend or improve the system.
- **Continuous Deployment** – Every push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions and `clasp push`, automatically updating the live Apps Script project.
- **Transparent Roadmap** – Anyone (or any AI) can see our milestones, planned features, and architecture decisions.

## 🧠 How Development Works

1. **Edit code in GitHub** → push to `main`.
2. **GitHub Actions** runs `clasp push` → updates Google Apps Script automatically.
3. **Apps Script Project** instantly reflects changes.
4. **Make.com, Canva, and social platforms** pick up updated behaviour automatically.

---

## 🆕 Buyer Self-Provisioning Workflow

New partner clubs can configure the automation stack without engineering support:

1. Open the Google Sheet that powers the automation, then choose **Extensions → Apps Script**.
2. In the Apps Script editor, run `showBuyerIntake` from the function dropdown to launch the onboarding form sidebar.
3. Complete the buyer intake form with club identity, branding colours, league/age information, and the initial roster.
4. Submit the form—details are persisted into Script Properties and mirrored into the `Buyer Profiles` / `Buyer Rosters` sheets.
5. Re-open the form at any time (rerun `showBuyerIntake`) to update badge assets, colours, or squad lists. The system instantly refreshes `SYSTEM_CONFIG` so automation flows use the new data.

The process is fully idempotent: each save updates the existing buyer profile using the unique buyer ID maintained in Script Properties.

## 📝 Workflow for Code & AI Collaboration

- All architectural context lives in **CLAUDE.md**, **PLANNING.md**, **TASKS.md**.  
- AI tools read those first, then modify files in `src/` under the defined rules:
  - No globals outside `config.js`
  - Comprehensive logging at entry/exit
  - Idempotent operations
  - Test hooks before/after external calls

This ensures any code generated respects your standards.

---

## 🔄 Deployment Details

- `.clasp.json` points to your Apps Script project (scriptId).  
- `.github/workflows/deploy-appsscript.yml` authenticates with a service account and pushes changes automatically.  
- Once you’ve set up the **service account secret** (see PLANNING.md), everything is free and hands-off.

## 🔐 Privacy & Consent Workflow (v6.2.0)

- **Live Consent Registry** – Player and guardian records live in the `Privacy Players`, `Privacy Consents`, and `Privacy Audit Log` sheets with automatic caching and retention enforcement.
- **Consent Gate** – Every Make.com payload (live events, weekly content, fixtures/results batches, and video clips) now flows through `ConsentGate.evaluatePost`, ensuring minors and revoked/expired consents fail closed.
- **Anonymisation Controls** – Global safeguards (`anonymiseFaces`, `useInitialsOnly`) live in the control panel and propagate with every payload so downstream tooling can mask faces or redact names.
- **Nightly Monitoring** – `sendConsentExpiryReport` runs nightly at the configured hour, logging audit entries and emailing stakeholders (when recipients are set) before consents lapse.
- **Operational Dashboard** – The control panel privacy card surfaces minors without consent, expiring consents, and recent blocks so staff can react immediately.

### QA Evidence

- **Control Panel Validation** – Verified toggles persist via Script Properties and rehydrate on load, while the dashboard mirrors sheet data for minors and expiring consents.
- **Webhook Gating** – Confirmed that blocking consent prevents Make.com calls (goal events, batch posts, weekly posts, video clips, monthly summaries) and that anonymisation flags ride along when allowed.
- **Scheduled Report** – Trigger scheduler now provisions a nightly `sendConsentExpiryReport` job, emitting audit rows and optional mail when recipients are configured.

## 🗄️ Free Backup to Google Docs/Drive (optional)

- You can add a **Google Apps Script function** (or a Make.com scenario) that:
  - Reads the files from this GitHub repo (via the raw URLs)
  - Concatenates them into one big string
  - Writes it to a Google Doc automatically  
- This can run hourly/daily as a free backup.  
- No paid services required — Apps Script and Drive are free.
