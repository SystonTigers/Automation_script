# Documentation Agent Charter (v7.0)

This directory hosts the architectural notes for the Cloudflare Workers Post Bus.

## Writing Guidelines

- Keep architecture docs concise and task-focused; prefer tables and callouts over prose.
- Update diagrams and configuration matrices when new bindings or secrets are introduced.
- Capture operational runbooks with step-by-step numbered lists.
- Reference source files using relative paths (e.g. `../backend/src/index.ts`).
- Include a "Last updated" footer with ISO 8601 timestamps when editing existing pages.
