# Roadmap deferral log

| Feature | Status | Rationale | Mitigation | Stakeholder Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sponsor overlay automation | Deferred pending asset pipeline | Creative assets, sponsor approvals, and Canva template variants are not yet provided; automation would produce incomplete overlays. | Capture sponsor requirements in the brand intake process and unblock with marketing asset delivery. | Approved by Head of Partnerships (Jamie Patel) during the 2025-10-04 sponsor sync; tracked in Confluence note `MKT-584`. |
| Monthly montage builder | Deferred until video asset policy finalised | Montage publishing depends on external editors and GDPR-compliant footage storage that are still in review. | Continue running GOTM automation and schedule montage work once media governance policy is signed off. | Confirmed by Media Governance Board (A. Rivera & L. Chen) in 2025-10-05 governance stand-up notes. |
