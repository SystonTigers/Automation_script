# Roadmap deferral log

| Feature | Status | Rationale | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage widget refresh | Deferred to Q4 2025 | The live web client requires UX redesign and content caching that sit outside the current automation remit. | Prioritise data-ready APIs and capture widget requirements with design team before sprint 24-Q4. |
| Sponsor overlay automation | Deferred pending asset pipeline | Creative assets, sponsor approvals, and Canva template variants are not yet provided; automation would produce incomplete overlays. | Capture sponsor requirements in the brand intake process and unblock with marketing asset delivery. |
| Monthly montage builder | Deferred until video asset policy finalised | Montage publishing depends on external editors and GDPR-compliant footage storage that are still in review. | Continue running GOTM automation and schedule montage work once media governance policy is signed off. |
